                        but our story starts way back to when our Master beekeeper, 
                        Andy, was a child living on a dairy fair in Bicol Region. 
                        Growing up Andy was exposed to bees and beekeeping on his 
                        family&apos;s farm as well as neighboring farms. Andy never imagined 
                        that him and his family would have created Cadie&apos;s Apiary nor 
                        did they know how successful it would be! But he did know 
                        that beekeeping was something he was extremely passionate about.
